## Deliverable 2 - Web 2.0 Application Development

### 1. GitHub Repository

* Repository URL: https://github.com/DiegoMartinezDeSanjuan/SportsEvents
* The codebase, including the `db.sqlite3` file, has been committed to facilitate testing.

### 2. Admin User and Test Users

* **Admin User:**

  * **Username:** admin
  * **Password:** admin
* **Test User:**

  * **Username:** didi
  * **Password:** PATATA123

### 3. Design Decisions and Model Changes

#### 3.1 Model Enhancements

* **Athlete Model:** Added a new `creator` field to link athletes to the user who created them, ensuring only the creator can modify or delete their instances.
* **Team Model:** No significant structural changes, but integrated with the `Athlete` model to allow automatic assignment of athletes to teams.
* **SportsEvent Model:** Now supports the association of both teams and individual athletes at the time of creation.

#### 3.2 Form Improvements

* **AthleteForm:**

  * Added custom widget for the `nationality` field to enable autocomplete with external country data using the REST Countries API.
  * Implemented client-side validation using AJAX for a more dynamic user experience.

#### 3.3 UI Enhancements

* Integrated jQuery to support real-time form validation and data fetching.
* Added autocomplete functionality for nationality fields with custom styling.

#### 3.4 External API Integration

* Implemented dynamic country suggestions for the `nationality` field using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to improve the user experience when creating athletes.

### 4. Testing and Next Steps

* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**

  * We encountered some obstacles we couldn't overcome when implementing the tests, so they are not available.
